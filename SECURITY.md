#  Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in SCA Module Catalogue, please **do not open a public issue** or merge request. Instead, report it privately using the Email: [adeline.schaefer@iese.fraunhofer.de](mailto:adeline.schaefer@iese.fraunhofer.de)

We take all security reports seriously and will respond promptly.

## What Happens Next?
We confirm the issue and assess its impact.

If needed, we work on a fix and coordinate a secure release.

Once resolved, we may publicly acknowledge your contribution (if you wish).

## Scope
This policy applies to the SCA Module Catalogue source code and infrastructure.

Please do not use this channel to report:

General bugs or feature requests → Use the GitLab Issues

Abuse, spam, or code of conduct violations → Contact our maintainers or see our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)


## Thank You

Thank you for helping keep SCA Module Catalogue safe and secure for everyone!
