# Comby Code of Conduct
Effective Date: 2025-08-01

## Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers of Comby, pledge to foster an open, safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone. We are committed to making participation in our project a respectful experience for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

- Showing empathy toward other community members

- Acknowledging and addressing mistakes openly

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

- Public or private harassment

- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

- Disruptive behavior that hinders community collaboration

- Plagiarism or intentional misrepresentation of others' work

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—such as the repository, issue tracker, pull request discussions, chat platforms, and events—and applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [adeline.schafer@iese.fraunhofer.de](mailto:adeline.schaefer@iese.fraunhofer.de) . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of the reporter.
